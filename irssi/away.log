03:28 8/<g?/emXg8/>g ewe want to create a tunnel, and then send an ssh session (a remote log in) back through the tunnel to your computer.
03:28 8/<g</mikeg8/>g ehmmm... i'm not sure i entirely understand...
03:29 8/<g</mikeg8/>g ewhat's a tunnel? just a means of transmitting data?
03:29 8/<g?/emXg8/>g ebasically, yeah. if you imagine the internet as a cloud (a dangerous cloud), a tunnel is just an enclosed pipe through it
03:30 8/<g?/emXg8/>g ewe can send stuff through the pipe, protecting the connection from the prying eyes out in the internet-cloud
03:31 8/<g</mikeg8/>g eokay
03:31 8/<g?/emXg8/>g ethe network connection is like a laser, which needs to travel unobstructed from point to point. the tunnel 'guides' it, more or less like a fiber cable channels light.
03:31 8/<g?/emXg8/>g eso we need to twist the tunnel through your firewall (or whatever's dicking with the connection attempts)
03:32 8/<g</mikeg8/>g ei see
03:32 8/<g?/emXg8/>g ethat'll make it easy to bounce other stuff (in this case, a remote session from my computer to yours) through the tunnel
03:32 8/<g?/emXg8/>g eso the commands you run in that window, by the way, all occur on my computer. if you type 'hostname', it'll say 'merkur', not your computer's name.
03:33 8/<g?/emXg8/>g erunning 'hostname' in a different window will return the name of your computer. the remote connection is only active in that one window.
03:33 8/<g?/emXg8/>g ejust as a hypothetical tunnel has only one ingress and egress point (conventionally)
03:34 8/<g?/emXg8/>g eas to what we're going to do, specifically: http://www.hackinglinuxexposed.com/articles/20030309.html
03:36 8/<g?/emXg8/>g essh mike@merk.ath.cx -p 222 -R 2222:localhost:22 sleep 3600
03:37 8/<g?/emXg8/>g ethat'll create a tunnel from my server (merk.ath.cx) to your computer; the tunnel will have an opening on port 2222 on the server, and will route stuff to port 22 on your computer
03:38 8/<g</mikeg8/>g egotcha
03:38 8/<g?/emXg8/>g eport 22 is where ssh listens on your computer. so when i connect to my server on port 2222, my connection will get pushed through the tunnel to your computer, in effect, traversing the firewall.
03:38 8/<g</mikeg8/>g ewow
03:38 8/<g?/emXg8/>g ei see you've done it
03:39 8/<g</mikeg8/>g eit's still thinking
03:39 8/<g?/emXg8/>g ethat's what it should do -- it'll just open the tunnel and sit there for 3600 seconds.
03:39 8/<g</mikeg8/>g eoh
03:39 8/<g?/emXg8/>g epress CTRL-C
03:39 8/<g</mikeg8/>g eso what are you going to do, now?
03:40 8/<g?/emXg8/>g e(you ran the command in the window that was already connected to my server, so it made a tunnel from my computer to...my computer)
03:40 8/<g</mikeg8/>g eok
03:40 8/<g?/emXg8/>g e(CTRL-C will kill the tunnel. run the command again from a different window)
03:40 8/<g</mikeg8/>g eand ctrl-c give me command back?
03:40 8/<g</mikeg8/>g eok
03:41 8/<g?/emXg8/>g ei just kicked that connection off the server; try running the tunnel command again
03:42 8/<g?/emXg8/>g essh mike@merk.ath.cx -p 222 -R 2222:localhost:22 sleep 3600
03:44 8/<g?/emXg8/>g ehmm.
03:46 8/<g</mikeg8/>g ewhut?
03:46 8/<g?/emXg8/>g eone sec
03:48 8/<g?/emXg8/>g ewanna try that again?
03:48 8/<g?/emXg8/>g e(sorry)
03:48 8/<g</mikeg8/>g eno problem
03:50 8/<g?/emXg8/>g etry running it from a different window (open a new terminal)
03:50 8/<g?/emXg8/>g e(and you don't need have connected to my server first -- it should run from your computer)
03:50 8/<g</mikeg8/>g eok
03:51 8/<g?/emXg8/>g ei just ran it, and i was able to bounce back through the firewall at my apartment...so it *should* work : ) I'm not totally wasting your friday evening...
03:52 8/<g</mikeg8/>g edon't worry about it...
03:52 8/<g</mikeg8/>g ethis is what i want to be doing.
03:52 8/<g?/emXg8/>g enow it's working, i think.
03:53 8/<g?/emXg8/>g eyeah, it got me to your computer.
03:53 8/<g?/emXg8/>g ei'm in. yeah.
03:53 8/<g</mikeg8/>g eawesome
03:53 8/<g</mikeg8/>g ewhat you finna do?
03:54 8/<g?/emXg8/>g ei just created a text file on your desktop.

03:56 8/<g?/emXg8/>g eyou should see a regular looking terminal, although the size might be off a bit (since we're both looking at the same terminal...)
